# VT-Inquirer
Python script that queries VirusTotal's APIv3 for malicious scores and other metadata for IPs, domains, URLs, and files.
(I will work on getting options to retrieve all metadata points, but for now my priority is retrieving malicious/all vendor scores.)

Based on Python.7. Working on Python3.
